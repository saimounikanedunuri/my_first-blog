                    Hello There! This is Sai Mounika Nedunuri. I love developing webpages: developed college webpage using Django Framework, a simple blog(this page), Resume using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Youtube webpage using React JS, Rest API, and many more...Also, i will be developing mobile applications with React Native. Having passion to learn something with consistent efforts makes success in career! I am quite good in these technologies. Apart from this, i am interested in learning and doing projects in AWS. There is lot more there to explore, learn and to do the projets. Learning is not only for the sake of doing job, getting salary: its a satisfation that "I DID THIS!!!". At the end of the day, how much i am happy with what i am doing is very important. 
                </p>


                <h2>Life is amazing</h2>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Life is too short to explore. Not only in a perspective of Learning, but also in every aspect of life( spending time with loved ones, travelling the world, showing gratitude, doing what we love,....its an infinite list).Many people will be inspiring us all the time. But most importantly, we should have confidence in ourself.
